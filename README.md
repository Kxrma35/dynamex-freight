## Commercial Reasoning

- The original Dynamex Freight website was vague. It did not provide much information and after placing a quote one could not track their shipment leading to the contacting customer care which is a leading cause of the company losing revenue and clients. Also, there was no way for a client to know the costs of shipping thus leading to unnecessary conflicts trying to negotiate.

- The solution Dynamex Freight website comes with a unified tracking system that allows one to trace their orders once after placing a quote and gives detailed explaination about the exact location of the clients items using the live map and also information about all the processes the items are going through. It also is embedded with a shipping rate estimator system that allows for one to estimate the amount of shipping inorder for proper budgeting and avoid unnecessary arguments on negotiations. The site is also embedded with a news page that allows both the employees and clients to access information on what is happening within the company and within the global market.

## Project Brief
The Dynamex Freght webpage is a static website created using HTML5 and Tailwind CSS utilities.

The static website showcases impressive features such as;

* The company's logistics capabilities across Air, Sea and Road Freights.
* It includes a shipping rate estimator and tracking interface.
* Also designed for easy customization and presentation to the clients.
* A news page that provides information on what is currently happening within the logistics market and the company itself.

Hero banner with strong call to action.

Services section with Air, Sea, and Road freight cards.

Track Orders page with a simple tracking input.

Request a Quote form on the Services page.

## Usage Instruction

1. Clone the repository: 
* using git bash clone the repository "git clone github.com/Kxrma35/dynamex-freight.git".

2. open the project folder.

3. open the index.html in any modern browser preferably.

## Strategic Case
The Dynamex Freight static webpage proves as a better alternative as compared to the original that left clients in an anxious state as one could not see what was happening after requesting a quote.

Through the new Dynamex Freight website one can now track their shipping through the tracking system implemented that provides a map for live tracking.

Also one can estimate how much the shipping rate is both nationally and internationally through the one of a kind implemented shipping rate estimator that allows one to budget wisely.
